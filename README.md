# Incoming features
I am currently working on a password vault : a place where you can store your password securely, without an once of data being sent on the internet, everything being secured by a master password. It takes time, so the readme screeshots won't show the actual app, but you can still make an idea !
I'm also working on making the design better, because I'm not a designer (yet, hopefully !).

Thanks for watching !
